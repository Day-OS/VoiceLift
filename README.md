Currently, this project serves as my Conclusion Paper.

VoiceLift is an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tool designed to enhance communication for individuals with speech disabilities. The goal of this project is to deliver a user-friendly interface equipped with advanced features that support effective and accessible communication.

My objective is to develop VoiceLift for at least two platforms: Linux and Android.

The motivation behind this project is deeply personal. After being diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and later recognizing that I experience selective mutism in certain situations, I became increasingly aware of the importance of accessible communication tools. I believe VoiceLift has the potential to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others who face similar communication barriers.

At present, the project is in its early development phase. My focus is on building the core functionalities and designing an intuitive and inclusive user interface.

This project will ALWAYS be FOSS, as I believe in the importance of open-source software for accessibility and inclusivity.
